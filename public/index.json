[{"content":"\rYour Impact\r500+\nPeople Fed\r50+\nEvents Posted\r100lbs\nFood Saved\rHi there! üëã\nWe started FreeFoodsNearMe with one simple belief: No one should ever have to worry about finding their next meal.\nWhat began as a small idea has turned into a mission: helping people discover nearby places offering free food, whether that‚Äôs a pantry, a local event, a community kitchen, or just another person. We know how tough it can be to ask for help, and how confusing it can be to figure out where to go. That‚Äôs why we built a space that makes it easy, judgment-free, and accessible for everyone.\nHere EVERYONE can post extra food they have, even if it\u0026rsquo;s only an extra bag of potatoes, and anyone nearby can find it. Along with that, we also list restaurants, food pantries, community kitchens, and local events offering free meals, because every bit of food shared makes a difference.\nWhy We Started This project grew out of a simple thought: there‚Äôs already enough food around us, it just doesn‚Äôt always reach the people who need it most. We wanted to build a platform that helps reduce waste, fights hunger, and brings people together through small acts of kindness.\nOur Belief Food is more than just something we eat. It represents community, care, and connection. Whether you‚Äôre sharing or receiving, there‚Äôs no shame here. Everyone deserves access to good food, and everyone has something to give.\nJoin the Movement If you have extra food, post it. If you‚Äôre looking for food, find it. If you know a program or event that should be listed, tell us. Together, we can make sure less food goes to waste and more people are fed.\nBecause no one should ever have to go hungry.\n","permalink":"https://freefoodsnearme.com/blog/about/","summary":"\u003cdiv style=\"background: #f5ede3; border-radius: 16px; padding: 24px 0; margin: 32px 0; text-align: center; box-shadow: 0 2px 8px #0001;\"\u003e\r\n  \u003cdiv style=\"color: #c89c3c; font-size: 1.7em; font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 16px;\"\u003e\r\n    Your Impact\r\n  \u003c/div\u003e\r\n  \u003cdiv style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center; gap: 48px; font-size: 1.3em;\"\u003e\r\n    \u003cdiv\u003e\r\n      \u003cspan style=\"color: #c89c3c; font-weight: bold; font-size: 0.8em;\"\u003e500+\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n      \u003cspan style=\"color: #888; font-size: 0.9em;\"\u003ePeople Fed\u003c/span\u003e\r\n    \u003c/div\u003e\r\n    \u003cdiv\u003e\r\n      \u003cspan style=\"color: #c89c3c; font-weight: bold; font-size: 0.8em;\"\u003e50+\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n      \u003cspan style=\"color: #888; font-size: 0.9em;\"\u003eEvents Posted\u003c/span\u003e\r\n    \u003c/div\u003e\r\n    \u003cdiv\u003e\r\n      \u003cspan style=\"color: #c89c3c; font-weight: bold; font-size: 0.8em;\"\u003e100lbs\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n      \u003cspan style=\"color: #888; font-size: 0.9em;\"\u003eFood Saved\u003c/span\u003e\r\n    \u003c/div\u003e\r\n  \u003c/div\u003e\r\n\u003c/div\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHi there! üëã\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe started FreeFoodsNearMe with one simple belief: \u003cstrong\u003eNo one should ever have to worry about finding their next meal.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e","title":"About FreeFoodsNearMe"},{"content":"We‚Äôd love to hear from you!
