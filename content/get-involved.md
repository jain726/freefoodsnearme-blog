At FreeFoodsNearMe, we believe that small acts of kindness can make a big difference.
Every shared meal, every post about extra food, and every conversation about helping others brings us closer to a world where no one goes hungry.

Whether you’re an individual, a student group, a restaurant, a pantry, or just someone who hates to see good food go to waste, **there’s a way for you to get involved.**

## 💚 Share Extra Food

Do you have leftovers from an event? Extra produce from your garden?
Instead of letting it go to waste, post it on FreeFoodsNearMe so someone nearby can enjoy it.

Your post could mean one less hungry night for someone in your community.

Together, we can turn food that might have been wasted into food that brings people together.
