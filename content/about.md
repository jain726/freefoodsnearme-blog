**Hi there! ðŸ‘‹**

We started FreeFoodsNearMe with one simple belief: **No one should ever have to worry about finding their next meal.**

What began as a small idea has turned into a mission: helping people discover nearby places offering free food, whether thatâ€™s a pantry, a local event, a community kitchen, or just another person. We know how tough it can be to ask for help, and how confusing it can be to figure out where to go. Thatâ€™s why we built a space that makes it easy, judgment-free, and accessible for everyone.

Here **EVERYONE** can post extra food they have, even if it's only an **extra bag of potatoes**, and anyone nearby can find it. Along with that, we also list restaurants, food pantries, community kitchens, and local events offering free meals, because every bit of food shared makes a difference. 

## Why We Started

This project grew out of a simple thought: thereâ€™s already enough food around us, it just doesnâ€™t always reach the people who need it most.
We wanted to build a platform that helps **reduce waste, fights hunger, and brings people together** through small acts of kindness.

## Our Belief

Food is more than just something we eat. It represents community, care, and connection. Whether youâ€™re sharing or receiving, thereâ€™s no shame here. **Everyone deserves access to good food, and everyone has something to give.**

## Join the Movement

- If you have extra food, post it.
- If youâ€™re looking for food, find it.
- If you know a program or event that should be listed, tell us.

Together, we can make sure less food goes to waste and more people are fed.

***Because no one should ever have to go hungry.***
